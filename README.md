Analysis of EMH applicability and predictive models for MICEX corprorate bond indices

Welcome. This is my bachelor degree thesis, which has received a very high mark (9/10) and was subsequently nominated for 3 awards.
The technical and statistical knowledge used was obtained from ICEF study programme, MIPT Deep Learning School (neural networks) and self-study. I thank my academic supervisor, Victor Lapshin, for valuable guidance.

For text version one might want to open the .doc file. If one wishes to see the code or help me to improve it, so that this paper can be enhanced further, one may proceed to .ipynb files.

All feedback is greatly appreciated.
